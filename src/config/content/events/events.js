    details: [
      "Calling all future chemical engineers! The AIChE's Chem-E-Car competition is a two-round challenge held at regional conferences, culminating at the annual Student Conference.",
      "The challenge is to design and build a miniature car propelled by the power of chemistry! The rounds include a poster competition that showcases your car's design and the know-how of the chemicals used. The ultimate test arrives when the car needs to cover a specified distance within a strict time limit. Safety comes first, and for that, teams are tested by a comprehensive safety program ensuring safe handling and disposal of chemicals throughout the competition, from preparation to operation. Chem-E-Car champions are finalized based on poster presentation, vehicle precision, safety consistency, and collaborative spirit."
